[00:10.52] Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear
[00:13.18] But you can't forget, from sundown to sunset, now
[00:20.59] It's all in the air, you hear it everywhere
[00:23.10] No matter what you do it's gonna grab a hold on you
[00:48.60] 
[00:29.23] California soul
[00:34.97] California soul
[00:42.47] 
[00:40.36] They say the sun comes up every morning
[00:45.29] And if you listen oh so carefully
[00:51.02] The winds that ride on the high tide
[00:56.58] Whistles a melody
[01:05.08] 
[01:00.38] So the people started to sing
[01:05.27] And that's how the surf gave birth untold
[01:10.13] To California soul
[01:15.53] California soul (Ooh, feels good)
[01:32.03] 
[01:21.45] When you hear the beat you wanna pat your feet
[01:24.07] And you've got ta move 'cause it's really such a groove, now
[01:31.65] Puts a brand new kind of thinking in your mind
[01:34.39] And you can't go wrong 'cause you're groovin' all day long
[02:03.39] 
[01:40.58] California soul
[01:45.93] California soul
[01:53.43] 
[01:51.26] They had the melody and the beat, yo
[01:56.90] But it still didn't seem complete, yes
[02:01.67] Until they saw two lovers kissing, oh sure
[02:07.38] They knew just what was missing
[02:22.88] 
[02:11.11] So happy they were rocking and reeling
[02:16.47] Because they had added that loving feeling
[02:21.41] To California soul
[02:26.86] California soul, might as well get with it
[02:33.15] Sound you hear that lingers in your ear
[02:35.75] Oh, you just cannot forget, from the morning 'till the sun goes down
[02:42.87] So just gimme, yeah, just gimme, yeah
[02:47.47] Oh, it's all a trend
