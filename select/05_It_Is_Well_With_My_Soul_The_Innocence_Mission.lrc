[00:06.52] When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
[00:14.81] When sorrows, like sea billows, roll
[00:19.44] Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say
[00:27.68] It is well, it is well with my soul
[00:45.18] 
[00:31.00] It is well
[00:32.82] It is well
[00:33.44] With my soul
[00:38.71] It is well
[00:40.74] It is well
[00:43.04] With my soul
